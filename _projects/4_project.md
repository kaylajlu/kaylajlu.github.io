I created a two-player chess game that is capable of all the standard chess features and blocks illegal moves. This was my 15-112 term project when I took the course the summer after my junior year of high school. I leveraged the object-oriented programming and Python coding skills I learned throughout the course, as well as used CMU Graphics and Tkinter to bring the project to life.
