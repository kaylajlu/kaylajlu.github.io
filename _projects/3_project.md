My teammate and I wrote a paper that provided a thorough analysis on the PageRank and HITS algorithms: two commonly used web-ranking algorithms. 

We started by explaining the mathematics behind the PageRank algoirthm. We introduced three distinct versions of it: Simple PageRank, Damped PageRank, and Dangling Node PageRank. Each version provides a prirority on different hyperlinks depending on the number of links connected to each hyperlink and the quality of them. We provided both mathematical explanations and code simulations of the algorithms.

We also examed the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm and conducted a similar process where we did a mathemtical breakdwon of the algorithm and simulated it through code.
