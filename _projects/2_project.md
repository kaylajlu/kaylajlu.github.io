During my sophomore fall, I took part in STEPR, which stands for Step-by-Step for Engine Performance Readiness. I worked with a team to research different methodologies to help U.S. Navy members access relevant instructional videos effectively. These videos were related to their daily tasks, and our goal was to leverage prompt engineering and various search methods to provide the most relevant video to a user based on their specific query.

After testing prompt engineering on different large language models, as well as experimenting with unique search methods such as vector search, we implemented a proof of concept that combined all of our findings.
