During my sophomore fall, I took part in STEPR, which stands for Step-by-Step for Engine Performance Readiness. I worked with a team to research into different methodologies to help US Navy members acess relevant instructional videos effectively. These videos were related to their daily tasks, and our team had the goal of leveraging prompt engineering and various search methods to provide the best video to a user based on their specific query.

After testing prompt engineering on different large language models as well as testing unique search method such as vector search, we implemented a proof of concept to put all of our findings together.
