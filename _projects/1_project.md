I created a two-player chess games that is capable of all of these standard chess game features and able to block illegal moves. This was my 15-112 term project when I took the course the summer after my junior year of high school. I leveraged my object-orineteg programming and Python coding skills I learned throughout the course as well as used CMU graphics and Tkinter to bring the project to life.
