I developed a two-player chess game that implements all standard chess rules and prevents illegal moves. This game was my 15-112 term project, where I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I gained throughout the course. I used object-oriented programming principles and Python, and incorporated both CMU Graphics and Tkinter to design and build an interactive, fully functional game.
