I developed a two-player chess game that implements all standard chess rules and prevents illegal moves. This game was my 15-11 term project, and I had the opportunity to apply all the knowledge and skills I gained throughout the course. I applied the object-oriented programming principles and Python skills that I learned, and used both CMU Graphics and Tkinter to design and build an interactive, fully functional game.
