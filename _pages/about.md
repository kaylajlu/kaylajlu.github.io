Hi! My name is Kayla, and I’m a computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m passionate about applying computer science to make a positive impact across diverse fields.

At Carnegie Mellon, I have completed a wide range of coursework, which has allowed me to develop an appreciation for the intersection of theory and practical application.

Outside of school, I have experience in full-stack development, robotics, traning large-language models, and more. I am eager to expand on what I learn about the usages of computer science.

I’m always happy to connect and chat about work opportunitites, collaboration, and impactful projects, so feel free to reach out!
