Hi! My name is Kayla, and I’m a computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m passionate about applying computer science to make a positive impact across diverse fields.

Through a broad range of coursework, I have developed an appreciation for the intersection of theory and practical application.

I also have experience in full-stack development, robotics, traning large-language models, and more. I am always eager to explore new ways computer science can be used.

I am happy to connect and chat about work opportunitites, collaboration, and projects, so feel free to reach out!
